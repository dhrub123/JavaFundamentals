Executors handle thread management. 
Task is a logical unit of work independent of other tasks. It represents object of a class implementing runnable.

Executor Framework executes logical tasks.
There are 3 interfaces - 
Executor Interface(forms the basis of java aync task execution framework - belongs to java.util.concurrent.Executor), ExecutorService and ScheduledExecutorService.

If thread is implemented manually, there can be infinite number of threads being spawned resulting in unbounded threads.

Threadpools are implementation of executor interface and its sub interfaces.
