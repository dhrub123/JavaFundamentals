all non private members are inherited. When we create a custom class in Java, it inherits all the non private members of the Java object class by default. The java object class has important methods like getClass() - returns runtime class of the object, toString() - string representation of object, equals() - is true only if the 2 objects being compared are same objects and hashcode(). The general contract is if 2 objects are equal, they must also have same hashcodes. So it is recommended to override hashcode() in case we override the equals().

Super keyword can access variables and methods of superclass like super.topSpeed and super.drive()
super() can also be used to call superclass constructor.
